# my-blog

My blog/website built using Next.js.

## rcws-development@2.0.0

### Migrate to Scrolling Layout.

This will mean not showing a navbar when at the top of the page & at a specific waypoint adding the navbar for easy navigation for the user. Look into [react-waypoint](https://github.com/brigade/react-waypoint) for this feature.

Blog posts will still link to their individual pages.

The `About Page` & `Tutorial Page` will be a part of the main layout & links from them will link out to external sites.

## TODO

- [ ] Read up on `react-waypoint`.
- [ ] Migrate to scrolling layout.
